# tabular-form

* INSTRUCTIONS *
Given a Component that will render _after_ page load, have that component
  * fetch data from an API endpoint "/api/parents", used a random API found online from randomapi.com
  * render results in tabular form with columns 

Used Next.JS, TailwindCSS, react-select, and https://randomuser.me/ for the API. Built over a Sunday. Mobile friendly.
